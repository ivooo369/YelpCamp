# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is the flagship project of Colt Steele's web development course on Udemy. I want to emphasize that this app is not my idea. I built it with the purpose of learning while coding alongside the instructor. Despite this, I gained a lot of knowledge and added additional functionalities myself.
